<h3>Hi!</h3>

<p>You seem smart and cool and also probably very handsome.
</p>
<p>That's why I'm inviting you and a guest to a dinner party at my home.
</p>
<h4>A dinner party?!</h4>
<img src="polaroid.jpg" width="400px">

<p>Over the last 4 years, I've hosted more than one hundred dinner parties. </p>
<p>Conversation is usually pretty lively. We've had: programming language creators, sculptors, dating site creators, painters, subway navigation app founders, bone broth magnates, banking app founders, painters, ted presenters, banksy painting owners, glassholes, pilots, bitcoin barons, furniture designers and more.</p>
<p>I cook. Past meals have included ramen from scratch, homemade pasta and <a href="http://cookingissues.com/index.html%3Fp=5731.html">lobsters tranquilized with isoeugenol</a></p>

<h4>What I need from you.</h4>

<p>
I ask every guest to <strong>bring a friend that you think is super amazing.</strong> Dinner is more fun with smart people and we rely on guests to bring superstars.
</p>
<p>If you want to bring a tribute, how about:</p>
<li>An exciting condiment</li>
<li>Flowers</li>
<li>A beverage</li>
<br/>
<em>Please don't bring food (or dessert), we've got that covered...</em>
<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!!
