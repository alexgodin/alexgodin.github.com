<h3>Hi!</h3>

<p>You seem smart and cool and also probably very handsome.
</p>
<p>That's why we're inviting you and a guest to a dinner party at our home.
</p>
<h4>A dinner party?!</h4>

<p>Over the last 4 years, we've hosted more than one hundred dinner parties. </p>
<p>Conversation is usually pretty lively. We've had: Programming language creators, Sculptors, Dating site creators, Painters, Subway navigation app founders, Bone broth guys, Banking app founders, Painters, TED presenters, Banksy painting owners, Glassholes, Pilots, Bitcoin dudes, Furniture designers and more.</p>
<p>We cook. Past meals have included ramen from scratch, homemade pasta and <a href="http://cookingissues.com/index.html%3Fp=5731.html">lobsters tranquilized with isoeugenol</a></p>

<h4>What we need from you.</h4>

<p>
We ask every guest to <strong>bring a friend that you think is super amazing.</strong> Dinner is more fun with smart people and we rely on guests to bring superstars.
</p>
<p>If you want to bring a tribute, how about:</p>
<li>An exciting condiment</li>
<li>Flowers</li>
<li>A beverage</li>
<br/>
<em>Please don't bring food (or dessert), we've got that covered...</em>
<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!!
