## Background

#### Influx of new users of emergency food services.

+ One in three NYC households have lost a job in the last few months.
+ Food Pantries are reporting record numbers of new clients.
+ As stimulus funding runs out, more and more people will need to turn to emergency food.

#### Lots of resource collection and need mapping, but poor user experience.

+ There are a dozen websites with lists of food resources.[^1] [^2] [^3] But, these resources are laid out as static pages that require reading comprehension and the ability to liberally use the "find in page" feature.
+ There are also SMS based solutions [^4] [^5] but they are limited in the number of pantries listed and are simply automated phone trees.
+ 311 is also supposed to help with this, but we hear that they're overwhelmed and unable to provide support.
+ Both Austin (at Lemontree/In It Together) and Christa (at City Harvest) have been fielding inbound requests from folks who are struggling to navigate this system.

#### Going to a pantry is intimidating and shame inducing.

+ Can you imagine the feeling of needing to rely on a helping hand for the first time.
+ In a country where self-sufficiency is prized above all else, there is tremendous pain in receiving aid.
+ The pantry system is increasingly complicated and includes lots of different types of services (home delivery, food for seniors, grab and go).

#### Lemontree (and everyone else) wants to understand what's next.

+ The last two months have been a blur. We're all reeling from a crisis. But, as things calm down, we'll enter into a long painful [slog](https://seths.blog/2020/05/vs-a-slog/).
+ The world is changing fast. Everyone knows that we need to see change, but no one totally understands what will be needed for the long haul.
+ Lemontree's core competency has always been quick iteration based on feedback. Now, we're getting ready to pivot again to serve wherever is most needed.

#### Volunteers willing to go deep

+ For some who have lost a job, volunteering is a way to fill the time (and add something to their resume). Many of our In It Together volunteers have signed up for shift after shift to fill the time[^6]
+ At Crisis Text Line 27,000 volunteers commit to 200 hours of service in their first year.[^7]

## Proposal

*INeedFood.nyc is a 24/7 hotline where you can text or call with a real human who will help you find free food resources near you.*


#### Initial Project

+ Users find us through partnerships with existing organizations, SEO and Google Ads (using our ad credit).
+ Each user is directed to text or call a phone number (TBD).
+ On the backend, our team of trained human volunteers work on a case by case basis to send back tailored resources and hold folks hands through their first experiences.
+ As they go, each volunteer is logging the results of each request and creating detailed data on each resource.

#### What next

+ We will have the best data on the emergency food system. We will understand what resources are working and which aren't.
+ We can use this knowledge to only recommend great resources to end users.
+ And, we can begin to work with funders to direct capital to only the best organizations.
+ And, we'll learn where the gaps are.  As gaps emerge, we can choose to build them ourselves or find partners who can step up.

### Open questions

+ How will people find this?
+ Will people who find it use it?
+ Is the data valuable?
+ Can we find and train volunteers efficiently?
+ Is it fundable in the long run?
+ Does this fit into our values (family dinner, scale)?
+ Do we feel excited to get out of bed and build this?
