<h4>About me</h4>

<p>I'm an entrepreneur. Recent projects have included <a href="TK MASHABLE LINK">a telethon</a>, <a href="TK tc link">software for small teams</a> and an <a href="TK LINK">adult summer camp</a>. These days, I am exploring a few new ventures and paying the bills by consulting. My passions include endurance sports, cooking and meditation. You can read more about me <a href="http://alex.nyc">here</a>.</p>

<p>I go to sleep early and most nights I am in the city for dinner.</p>
 
<p>Once a week, I have friends over for a casual dinner party (everyone leaves by 11:30 at the latest). Once a quarter, I host a small party (These usually happen during the day). The fridge always has leftovers and ingredients, which you are welcome to (as long as you ask).</p>
